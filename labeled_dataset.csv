176,2019-11-07 12:50:48,"Hi there,Currently in the marketplace for a '16 GLA 250 4matic and I seem to have come across the perfect one. Except, I am not sure if it has CarPlay or not. I checked its packages with the VIN and found that it has 'COMAND APS NTG5/NTG5.5'. Is that enough for it to have it?I have already spent some money getting it inspected (it's in a different state than I am) and would really hope it is. The only reason it even came to my mind that it may not have it is that I test drove one where I live and the dealer said that it is an option, but that car was not equipped with navigation.Fingers crossed.

* * * Read Description Before Calling or Texting * * * *

This vehicle starts right up and runs, but does not have any pickup at all. I'm not sure if it is simething simple like a sensor(s) or something else. It was running fine and then started acting up all of a sudden. It is showing 2 problem codes, which I believe reference the engine running too rich. At the same time this happened, it also started running hot. I think the fan clutch may be bad, but I'm not sure. I have bought another car, so I'm selling this one. I have the clear blue title in my name.

The A/C works good and the interior looks good. all the power windows work good - I recently replaced the driver's power window regulator and motor. It has a recent full synthetic oil change. It has a brand new K&N air filter. The inspection is good until August of this year. It's a 3rd row seat. It doesn't leak any fluids that I know of.

It does have a cracked windshield (Will pass inspection). The speedometer and odometer do not work, they have been broke for several years (will pass inspection as these items are not checked in Texas). They were broken when I bought the vehicle. It does need new front tires (front tires would not pass inspection). The back tires are ok.
All in all, it would be a nice vehicle if it was fixed up a little bit.

Serious inquiries only. If interested, please call or text. If calling, please leave a message as I do not answer calls from unknown numbers. Thanks",1,,,used,sell,,

This is a 2003 Land Rover Discovery SE 7
I am the 2nd Owner and purchased the vehicle from my neighbor in 2007 at 50,000 miles. The vehicle was maintained by the dealer during the warranty period and has been professionally maintained by the same Land Rover mechanic for the last 12 years. This is an incredibly capable off road vehicle and adventure wagon with the safari rack and tow package. No warning lights and passed through DEQ in July, so brand new tags. Recent investment includes:

* NEW Heads and Gaskets at 119,500 miles
* NEW Intake Manifold and Valve Cover Gaskets at 119,500
* NEW Water Pump and Coolant at 119,500
*NEW High Performance Front Brakes and Rotors at 130,000 miles
*Nokian Snowflake Rated Tires with about 40% tread remaining
* NEW Oil Change
*NEW Oregon Tags with DEQ Pass July/2019

BFG tires in stock size, with 11/32 tread remaining.  Weathertech mats from front to cargo area. All lights upgraded to LED both interior and exterior.

It works well enough, but will click itself off quickly mid-turn and sometimes I have to give it a jiggle to stop it from blinking. It isn't more than a annoyance at times and I just click it back on a couple times at roundabouts etc. but I would like to fix if I can.  I have had the center column apart a few times searching for a short that causes my M13 fuse to blow and the stalk is on that circuit. But pulled it out and same issue so the stalk itself should be fine in terms of an obvious short problem.  Wondering if this is something I can fix without finding a replacement or if anyone has any ideas before I just find a wrecked JK and get the switch off of that. Looks like I can get one for about $100-120, so isn't the end of the world if I do.  Thanks in advance. I know it's very specific, but can't hurt to ask. FunnelAI Tag: Jeep",1,,,,service,,

44,2019-11-07 12:50:48,"2011 Ford Fiesta in Perfect Mechanical Condition I am selling my 2011 Ford Fiesta Hatchback.

Here is the complete history of the car:
- I bought the car in November 2013 when it already had about 58,000 in mileage. Before buying I had the car inspected by a third party. He said the car was in perfect condition except a few minor things (that I foxed later). I'm attaching that inspection report.
- In the 6 years that I drove the car, I added only about 30,000 more miles. When I lived in Austin, I used the car mostly to get grocery. In San Antonio I use it also to commute to work.
- I've never smoked in the car.
- The car is in perfect mechanical condition. I did the 29-point Good Year inspection recently and the car passed everything. (Receipt available)
- The car has 4 new tires. (Receipt available)
- The coolant was refilled recently. (Receipt available)
- The brake system was serviced recently. (Receipt available)
- The car has got its oil change regularly.

- The car's audio system does not work at all. I don't know where the problem is but I haven't tried to fix it because I use my phone to listen to music, etc.
- The car has been in 1 accident in 2014. A golf cart that was backing up hit the rear driver side door. That door was fully replaced by the car shop.
- 1 month ago during a road trip to West Texas, the rear driver side tire blew up and the blown tire hitting the bumper before I brought the car to full stop caused some damage to the rear bumper and the driver side rear quarter. Since the bumper had become loose and was a safety hazard, I removed it completely so the car has no rear bumper now. The damages can be seen in the pictures. Since the car didn't have collision/comprehensive coverage, I couldn't fix them.


So to sum it up, it's a car that drives perfectly, but does not look good. I had planned to keep it for another 2 years at least that's why I spent about $1000 on it this year. But after the incident with the bumper I decided to sell it.

If you need a cheap car that confidently takes you from point A to B and has super cold AC, and if you don't mind the cosmetic imperfections, this can be a great car for you.

Without the cosmetic issues, the car would be worth about $4500.

I love this truck and keep up on routine maintenance. If you know manual Nissans, you know this truck will keep running as long as you maintain it.

Work that's been done recently:
I replaced the fuel filter a couple of years ago, alternator and battery about 3 years ago, and the rear brakes about a year ago. It has good tires, put on with 90% tread last summer. Had the engine tuned up by Dean's Car Care last spring, with new spark plugs and wires.

The 2015 Toyota Venza excites with a stylish look and wide, athletic stance that stands out from other crossovers. Its stunning exterior styling includes sleek lines, a stylish upper and lower grille, and modern looking fog lamps and taillights. The 2015 Toyota Venza offers a sophisticated profile and sleek design to make every arrival a powerful one, while a luxurious cabin and spacious interior provide plenty of comfort. The 2015 Venza is offered in 3 trims: the base LE, the mid range XLE, and the top level Limited. A 2.7-Liter, 4-Cylinder, 181hp engine is standard on the LE and XLE, but is unavailable on the Limited. Alternatively, a 3.5-Liter, V6 engine with 268hp is standard on the Limited and available on the lower trims. Whatever engine options you go with, they are both paired with a 6-speed Electronically Controlled Automatic Transmission. While Front-wheel drive comes standard, Toyota offers all-wheel drive as an option on all Venza trims. Fuel economy is almost the same on all trims and drivetrain combinations, but the 4-Cylinder Front-wheel drive is the best performer with an EPA estimated 21MPG CTY and 27 MPG HWY. The 2015 Toyota Venza has an interior that is big in all directions with generous head and leg room. Based on the trim, comfortable seating options include cloth or leather upholstery, heated front seats, and a power driver's seat with power lumbar support. The Venza offers an impressive 70.2 cubic feet of cargo space. Plus, it features one-touch fold-flat levers located in the cargo area for the rear seats. Standard safety features include 7 airbags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, a tire pressure monitor system, and much more. Source: The Manufacturer Summary",1,,,used,sell,,

Installed a new front passenger tire and got an oil change 3 weeks ago and had the engine checked this week by a mechanic with no issues reported. Have driven through mountains and cross country with it and never ran into any trouble.

I am the 2nd owner, the first owner having had it the longest with a clean bill of health and regular maintenance. The only reason I am selling it is that I will soon move out of the country for work.


There are a few stains and light cosmetic wear on the interior, but I have had it professionally cleaned to prepare for the next owner. The speaker system is lovely, but one will need to update it for Bluetooth or aux chord (for now I've been using an external speaker).

The price is somewhat negotiable, but with the care and maintenance put into the car, It's a fair asking price. Kelly Bluebook retail is $3,628- $4,671.",1,,,used,sell,,

460,2019-11-07 12:50:48,"Hey guys,Well, my family is parting ways with our 1999 4runner.  We have owned it since new, it was a great family hauler for most of its life, but it has been used as a hauler for dirt/mulch/plants the past few years.  Accordingly the interior is trashed, further, the windows were left down during a  vacation and the interior got pretty wet.  This mistake caused mold on the interior, so the carpet was removed, but the seats are a bit gross as well.  All interior electronics work fine, however.Mileage: 165,xxxThe frame is clean, no rust aside from surface level.  The motor appears strong, would be nice to swap into a 1st gen!  Notice the wheels, fairly clean 5-stars, there is a bit of oxidation on one wheel in a single spot, but in good shape otherwise.  The tires are also new with less than 1,000 miles on them.It also has Tundra brakes on the front, which may be worth swapping.It handles poorly, as the front sway bar broke at some point, and the rear sway bar is non-existant.  But it does drive!Asking $950 OBO, it is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. FunnelAI Tag: Toyota",1,,,used,sell,,

Am i correct in the assumption that in order to get the engine running I will need to use the OBD1 harness with the OBD2b engine and change the dizzy by rewiring it into a 2 pin configuration (I do have the OBD 1 dizzy), add wires for VTEC, knock sensor and O2 sensor. I may also need to add the obd1 injectors.  Cliff notes -  93 del sol OBD1 harness onto 2000 Civic DX D16y8 Need to change distributor possibly Need to add VTEC and sensor wires, IACV wires need changed as well Unsure if fuel injectors also need to be swapped out p2p ECU from 2000 civic p28 ECU from Del sol FunnelAI Tag: Honda",1,,,,service,,

495,2019-11-07 12:50:48,So I got my x3 2019 and seats in back were pretty much untouched and perfect condition. Then I had to give ride to this girl I been hanging out with (which cost me arm and leg btw but she so darn cute lol) and helped her move. Upon bringing the seats down I forgot to take the water (two Evian water bottles) and   Left a ding that probably seems permanent. She never informed me about more luggage so i totally forgot about the bottles upon getting there. Next day I go wake up to go to beach for walk I pull seats up and see the ding and my heart cringed. I'm really into detailing so things like this bothers me a lot. I saw YouTube solution but it's meant for softer leather but x3 seats are pretty tough (which is good as it could have been worse) any solution or tips?  So far I just massaged it and got slightly better but still feel my car aged with wrinkle hahaha FunnelAI Tag: BMW,1,,,,service,,
434,2019-11-07 12:50:48,"This will be my first Corvette. I'm looking to spend about 12,000.00 or a little more if it's a good deal. I like the C5 with the standard 400HP. My question is what kind of mileage can I expect the Corvette to last keeping up with maintaining it?  Being from MA will the salt and winter be a problem with rust being that it's a fiberglass body? Also how much does it cost to replace the tires? I drive about 6000 miles a year although I'm sure that will change if I purchase a vette.   My name is Gerard and it was a pleasure introducing myself to the Community. Looking forward to learning more about the Corvette and the mechanical workings of this fine sports car.

211,2019-11-07 12:50:48,"I'm planning on purchasing a 2020 Transit, Medium length, high roof. I fly large R/C model airplanes ( 100' wing span, 25-35 lbs). I presently own a 2013 Sprinter with only 18,000 miles. I have an extended warranty that is good until July 2020. The cost of maintaining the Sprinter is to much. If not for the extended warranty, I would have spent $8,000 on problems I've had. Once the warranty is gone, the Sprinter will be gone. Enough about the Sprinter.What I need is a Transit that will seat five but 99% of the time it will only be the wife & me and the second seat will be removed to make room for the model airplanes. The new crew van looks like what I need but I have a few questions. Is the second seat removable? Can I get all the upgrades that are available on a passenger van on a crew van? If not, can I order a passenger van with only the second seat?Thanks for any information.Jay FunnelAI Tag: Ford",1,,,used,sell,,
